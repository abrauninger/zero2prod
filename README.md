# Newsletter app

Sample implementation of the application project from [Zero To Production In Rust](https://zero2prod.com), with custom frontend code.

After finishing the exercises in the book, I added on to the implementation with a custom frontend, implemented with Vue and Tailwind.

Note that this repo differs from [Luca Palmieri's reference implementation](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/zero-to-production), although occasional code snippets were copied from that implementation.

## How to deploy
This application is designed to be hosted on DigitalOcean App Platform.

To deploy, use `doctl create` with `spec.yaml`.
